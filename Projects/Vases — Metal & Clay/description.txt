Vases — Metal & Clay
---
A set of stylized hand-painted vases focused on contrasting materials and surface qualities.
The project explores the difference between a magical metallic vessel and a clay pot, with emphasis on shape readability, material separation, and conveying surface properties through hand-painted color and lighting.
