Lava, Ice & Wood
---
A set of stylized hand-painted props exploring different materials and visual moods.
The project includes a molten lava stone, an ice core covered in snow, and a wooden beam — each painted entirely by hand without procedural textures. The focus was on shape readability, color harmony, and creating convincing material definition through painted lighting and form.
